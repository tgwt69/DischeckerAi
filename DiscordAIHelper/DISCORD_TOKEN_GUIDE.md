# Discord Token Troubleshooting Guide - 2025

Your Discord token validation passed but Discord is rejecting it with "Improper token has been passed." This is a common issue with user tokens. Here are several methods to get a fresh, working token.

## Current Issue
- Token format appears correct (70 characters)
- Discord API rejects it as "improper"
- Usually indicates an expired or incomplete token

## Method 1: Browser Network Tab (Recommended)

1. **Clear Discord completely**:
   - Sign out of Discord on ALL devices
   - Clear browser cache/cookies for discord.com
   - Close all Discord tabs

2. **Get fresh token**:
   - Open https://discord.com in Chrome/Firefox
   - Log in normally
   - Press F12 → Network tab
   - Clear network log (trash icon)
   - Send any message or click a server/channel
   - Look for requests to `/api/v9/channels/` or similar
   - Click on the request → Headers tab
   - Find `authorization:` in Request Headers
   - Copy the ENTIRE value (should be 70+ characters)

## Method 2: Console Method (Alternative)

1. Open Discord in browser
2. Press F12 → Console tab
3. Paste this code:
   ```javascript
   (webpackChunkdiscord_app.push([[''],{},e=>{m=[];for(let c in e.c)m.push(e.c[c])}]),m).find(m=>m?.exports?.default?.getToken!==void 0).exports.default.getToken()
   ```
4. Copy the returned token (without quotes)

## Method 3: Local Storage Method

1. Open Discord in browser
2. Press F12 → Application tab (Chrome) or Storage tab (Firefox)
3. Expand Local Storage → https://discord.com
4. Look for key containing "token"
5. Copy the value (remove quotes if present)

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Token Still Invalid After Fresh Copy
- **2FA Enabled**: Disable 2FA temporarily, get token, re-enable 2FA
- **Account Locked**: Check if Discord flagged your account
- **Browser Extensions**: Disable ad blockers and privacy extensions
- **VPN/Proxy**: Try without VPN if using one

### Token Format Issues
- Remove `Bearer ` prefix if present
- Remove quotes at beginning/end
- Ensure no spaces or newlines
- Token should be exactly 70 characters for most users

### Regional/Network Issues
- Try different browser (Chrome vs Firefox)
- Use incognito/private mode
- Try from different network/location
- Clear DNS cache: `ipconfig /flushdns` (Windows)

## Security Notes
⚠️ **Important**: User tokens violate Discord's ToS
- Use at your own risk
- Don't share tokens with anyone
- Tokens can expire without warning
- Discord may suspend accounts using selfbots

## Quick Test
After getting new token:
1. Update `config/.env` file
2. Run: `python test_token.py`
3. Should show successful connection

## Still Having Issues?
If all methods fail:
1. Account may be flagged by Discord
2. Try creating new Discord account
3. Wait 24-48 hours and try again
4. Contact if you need further assistance
