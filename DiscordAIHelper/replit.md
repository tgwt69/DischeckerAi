# Discord AI Selfbot - 2025 Edition

## Overview

This is a Discord selfbot application built with Python that integrates AI capabilities through Groq and OpenAI APIs. The bot can engage in conversations, analyze images, and provide various utility commands. It's designed with modern Python practices, enhanced security features, and comprehensive error handling.

**Important Note**: This is an educational project that violates Discord's Terms of Service. Use at your own risk.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Discord Interface**: Uses `discord.py-self` library for Discord API interaction
- **Command System**: Implements a cog-based command structure with separate modules for general and admin commands
- **User Interface**: Terminal-based interface with colorized output using `colorama`

### Backend Architecture
- **Event-Driven**: Asynchronous event handling for Discord messages and commands
- **Modular Design**: Organized into separate utilities for AI, database, error handling, and helpers
- **State Management**: Maintains conversation context and user preferences in memory and database

### Database Architecture
- **SQLite Database**: Local file-based storage for persistence
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: Uses thread-local storage for database connections
- **Connection Pooling**: Context manager pattern for automatic connection cleanup

## Key Components

### Core Bot (`main.py`)
- Main bot instance and event handlers
- Message processing and AI response generation
- Rate limiting and anti-detection measures
- Conversation memory and context management

### Command System (`cogs/`)
- **GeneralCommands**: User-facing commands (help, stats, channel management)
- **AdminCommands**: Owner-only commands (reload, maintenance, system info)

### AI Integration (`utils/ai.py`)
- **Groq API**: Primary AI provider using `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` model
- **OpenAI**: Fallback provider using `gpt-4o` model
- **Image Analysis**: Vision model support for image recognition
- **Error Handling**: Automatic fallback between providers

### Database Operations (`utils/db.py`)
- Channel management (active channels for AI responses)
- User management (ignored users, statistics)
- Conversation logging and error tracking
- Data cleanup and maintenance functions

### Error Management (`utils/error_notifications.py`)
- Discord webhook notifications for errors
- Rate limiting for error notifications
- Comprehensive error logging and categorization

## Data Flow

1. **Message Reception**: Bot receives Discord messages through websocket connection
2. **Processing Pipeline**: 
   - Check if channel is active for AI responses
   - Validate user permissions and rate limits
   - Extract message content and context
3. **AI Processing**:
   - Send message to primary AI provider (Groq)
   - Fallback to secondary provider (OpenAI) if needed
   - Process response and handle errors
4. **Response Generation**:
   - Split long responses into Discord-compatible chunks
   - Apply typing simulation for realistic behavior
   - Send response with rate limiting
5. **Data Storage**: Log conversation data and statistics to SQLite database

## External Dependencies

### AI Providers
- **Groq API**: Primary AI service with free tier
- **OpenAI API**: Secondary AI service for fallback

### Python Libraries
- `discord.py-self`: Discord API interaction
- `groq`: Groq API client
- `openai`: OpenAI API client
- `sqlite3`: Database operations
- `httpx`: HTTP requests
- `yaml`: Configuration file parsing
- `colorama`: Terminal color output

### Environment Variables
- `DISCORD_TOKEN`: Discord user token
- `GROQ_API_KEY`: Groq API key
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API key (optional)
- `ERROR_WEBHOOK_URL`: Discord webhook for error notifications (optional)

## Deployment Strategy

### Local Development
- Python 3.11+ required
- Virtual environment recommended
- Configuration through YAML files and environment variables
- Setup wizard for initial configuration

### Cloud Deployment (Render.com)
- **Ready for Render**: Includes all necessary deployment files
- **Environment Detection**: Automatically configures for cloud environments
- **Port Handling**: Uses Render's PORT environment variable
- **Persistent Storage**: Database handling optimized for cloud deployment
- **Health Monitoring**: Multiple endpoints for uptime monitoring

### Production Considerations
- **Security**: Anti-detection measures and rate limiting
- **Monitoring**: Error logging and webhook notifications
- **Maintenance**: Database cleanup and system monitoring commands
- **Reliability**: Automatic fallback between AI providers
- **Cloud Compatibility**: Works on Render, Replit, and other platforms
